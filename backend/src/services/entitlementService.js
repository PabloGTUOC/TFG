/**
 * Family entitlements (docs/admin-family-management-plan.md Phase 3).
 *
 * The backend is the single source of truth: clients never ask a store or a
 * billing SDK what a family may do — they ask us, and this module answers by
 * merging up to three sources, most generous wins:
 *
 *   1. the default plan (baseline every family has),
 *   2. the family's subscription plan, only while in good standing
 *      (trialing / active / in_grace),
 *   3. any unrevoked, unexpired admin grants (comps/trials).
 *
 * Limit semantics: a plan's `limits` JSONB maps limit keys (max_members,
 * max_actors, max_active_rewards, …) to integers; an absent key means
 * unlimited for that source, and unlimited from any source wins the merge.
 *
 * Status semantics: canceled/expired/paused subscriptions simply stop
 * conferring benefits (graceful downgrade to the default plan). Only
 * `past_due` — payment owed beyond the store's grace window — puts the
 * family in read-only mode via assertFamilyWritable.
