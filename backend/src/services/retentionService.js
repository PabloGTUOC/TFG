/**
 * Retention for abandoned families (docs/admin-family-management-plan.md
 * Phase 6).
 *
 * The privacy boundary means an admin never deletes family data directly;
 * they trigger a *process*: send an inactivity notice (Phase 2, audited),
 * wait, and then this sweep deletes families that stayed silent. Both steps
 * are visible in admin_audit_log.
 *
 * A family qualifies only when BOTH hold:
 *   - last_active_at is older than `inactiveDays` (default 365), and
 *   - the most recent 'family.notify_inactive' audit entry is older than
 *     `noticeDays` (default 30) — the family was warned and didn't return.
 *
 * Deletion re-verifies inactivity in its own WHERE clause so a family that
 * came back between listing and deletion is skipped, and it cascades via
 * the existing ON DELETE rules. The audit row is attributed to the admin
 * whose notice started the process.
